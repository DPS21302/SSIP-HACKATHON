Problem ID                          : PID697
Challenge Title                     : E-Challan Payment

Name of the Office                  : The Smart City Ahmedabad Development Ltd.

Challenge Description with context  : Out of the total e-challans issued in the current times, only 30-35% are responded to by the citizens.  Although lacs of challans are generated each day, the manpower limitation leads to issuing of only a thousand of them. This non-issuance of challans causes revenue loss as backdated challans can always be disputed. Therefore, currently only 30% citizens actually end up paying challans that are issued to them.  The problem to be addressed here is how can the rate of fine payers be increased using a digital solution?
Better e-challan collection.

Users                               : City Traffic Police
Expected Outcomes                   : Higher collections
Impact                              : Better traffic law following

â€¢ E-challan pay by an effective way is a web-portal which will help the government in improving the e- challan collection. This system shall provide an alternative way of linking the e-challan issued to a citizen with a fixed cyclic bill that the citizen pays without fail such as their electricity bill.  Linking of e-challan fines with a cyclic bill like electricity bill will restrain the citizens from ignoring it, shall facilitate the fine collection for traffic police department and shall bring in awareness amongst the citizens leading to lesser traffic violations.
